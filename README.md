# Project Reflection

## 1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The project was about creating a course planner that could load course data from a file and let users look up information about different courses. It needed to list all the courses in order and also show details like prerequisites for a specific course. The main problem was organizing the data in a way that made it easy to search and display.

## 2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I started by thinking about the best way to store the data so I could find things quickly and easily. I used a map to connect each course number with its details, which helped with fast lookups. I also used vectors for the list of prerequisites because they’re flexible and easy to work with. Understanding data structures really helped because picking the right ones made the program run better and made the code easier to write.

## 3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

One of the issues I had was making sure the program handled all types of input correctly. For example, if someone typed in a course number with spaces or lowercase letters, it might not work at first. I fixed this by trimming whitespace and converting input to uppercase. Another challenge was reading the CSV file correctly and turning it into usable data. I had to test different ways to split the lines and handle missing information. Also, when I realized the professor expected us to use the virtual machine, I made sure to switch to it even though my code was already working outside of it.

## 4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project helped me think more about how to plan a program before actually coding. I learned to break the problem into smaller steps and figure out how users would interact with it. I also started thinking more about the structure of my code and making sure each part had a clear job. It made me realize how important it is to plan out the design first so everything fits together better.

## 5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Doing this project taught me how important it is to keep code clean and easy to understand. I used better variable names, added comments to explain what I was doing, and kept my functions focused on one task at a time. Now I try to write code that not only works but is also easier to fix or update later. I feel like I could go back to this project in the future and still understand what’s going on or even add new features without too much trouble.
